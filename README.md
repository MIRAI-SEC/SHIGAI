# SHIGAI - Ransomware-Focused EDR

SHIGAI is an open-source GitHub project that aims to provide an advanced Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution specifically designed to combat ransomware attacks. It leverages a combination of kernel-level driver and mini-filter to intercept and monitor file system activities, enabling real-time analysis and detection of ransomware behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Kernel-Level Driver**: SHIGAI utilizes a robust kernel-level driver to gain deep visibility into file system operations, enabling efficient interception and monitoring of file-related activities.
- **Mini-Filter**: The mini-filter component enhances the capabilities of the kernel driver by intercepting file I/O requests, allowing for real-time analysis and decision-making based on behavior patterns.
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: SHIGAI incorporates a machine learning model that operates on a separate machine, designed to detect and identify anomalous behaviors associated with ransomware attacks.
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: By employing machine learning algorithms, SHIGAI is capable of analyzing file system activities and detecting deviations from normal behavior, helping identify potential ransomware activities.
- **Real-Time Alerting**: When suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, SHIGAI promptly generates alerts, allowing security teams to respond swiftly and mitigate potential damage.
- **Scalability**: SHIGAI is designed to handle large-scale deployments, making it suitable for enterprise-level environments with a high volume of endpoints.
- **Extensibility**: The project provides a flexible architecture that enables the addition of custom detection rules and integration with existing security solutions.

## How SHIGAI Works

1. **Kernel-Level Monitoring**: SHIGAI's kernel-level driver monitors file system activities, including file creations, modifications, and deletions, as well as network-related events.
2. **Mini-Filter Analysis**: The mini-filter intercepts file I/O requests and forwards them for analysis to the machine learning component.
3. **Machine Learning Analysis**: The machine learning model operates on a separate machine, leveraging historical data and behavioral analysis to determine the likelihood of a file being associated with ransomware.
4. **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: SHIGAI compares the observed file behavior against learned patterns and identifies any anomalies or suspicious activities.
5. **Real-Time Alerting**: When potential ransomware behavior is detected, SHIGAI generates alerts, providing security teams with actionable information to investigate and mitigate the threat.
